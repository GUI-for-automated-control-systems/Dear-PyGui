Desktop app for realtime vm monitoring by Dear-PyGui and paramiko.

By establishing a connection to a remote device via SSH protocol, it becomes possible to retrieve data on the operating system, RAM size, CPU utilization level, and active system operation time. In addition, this connection provides the ability to monitor the load in real time, send commands through the terminal and transfer files to the remote server.
